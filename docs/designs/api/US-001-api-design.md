# API Design — US-001 Customer Registration (v2)

Companion to `docs/designs/api/US-001-openapi.yaml` (the authoritative contract).
This document is the traceability anchor: rationale, operation notes,
Acceptance-Criterion map, auth model, error model, and open questions.

> **v2 revision note:** re-derived from Specification v2 after the project's
> technology re-platform to ASP.NET Core/EF Core/SQLite (loop-back from
> `RECONCILIATION` v2, key `specification_gap`). The wire-level JSON contract
> (paths, schemas, status codes, error-body shape) is unchanged from v1 — it
> was already stack-neutral. Only server-side mechanism references in the
> design notes were corrected: Jakarta `@Email` → FluentValidation rule,
> Bean Validation → FluentValidation, `@RestControllerAdvice`/`exception`
> package → `GlobalExceptionHandler`/`Exceptions` namespace, JPA auditing →
> `AppDbContext.SaveChangesAsync` audit override, and the unknown-JSON-field
> rejection mechanism is now correctly attributed to System.Text.Json
> (`UnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow`) rather than the validation layer.

## 1. Scope

US-001 adds exactly one operation: `POST /api/v1/customers` — public
self-registration of a Customer account. No existing contract changes; this is
purely additive, so there is no compatibility concern (api-conventions.md AC-1).

`GET /api/v1/customers/{id}` is referenced only by the `Location` header of the
`201` response; it is **not** implemented by this Story (US-003 territory). The
header value is still correct and stable.

## 2. Open Decisions applied

| OD | Resolution | Effect on this contract |
|---|---|---|
| OD-001 | A — standard email-address shape (FluentValidation rule) + maxLength 254 | `RegistrationRequest.email`: `format: email`, `maxLength: 254`, `minLength: 1` |
| OD-002 | B — CSRF-exempt for `POST /api/v1/customers` only | `security: []`, `x-csrf-exempt: true`; recorded here as the Story's architecture decision (SC-5). CSRF stays enabled for every other endpoint. |
| OD-003 | A — explicit `409` | `409` response with body message `"An account with this email already exists."` |
| OD-004 | A — `id, email, role, createdAt` | `CustomerResponse` field list |
| OD-005 | A — anti-abuse out of scope | No rate-limit headers, no `429` in this contract |
| OD-006 | A — lowercase-in-service + plain `UNIQUE` | No contract impact; `email` in `CustomerResponse` is the normalized (lowercase) value. DB_DESIGN owns the mechanism. |

## 3. Request-shape policy (resolves spec-review F-2 / Spec §6.3)

**Unknown or extra JSON properties in the request body are rejected with `400`**
(request-shape failure) — never silently ignored. Expressed in the contract as
`additionalProperties: false` on `RegistrationRequest`. Rationale: NFR-002
forbids relying on framework defaults for input handling; an explicit reject is
the stricter, more predictable contract and gives TEST_WRITING a deterministic
case. Implementation note (non-binding on the contract): this is a
JSON-deserialization concern, not a FluentValidation rule —
`JsonSerializerOptions.UnmappedMemberHandling =
JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` (System.Text.Json), with the resulting
`JsonException` mapped to `400` by the `GlobalExceptionHandler`.

Malformed JSON → `400` with the AC-6 body (Spec §6.3).

## 4. Operation: `registerCustomer`

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Method / path | `POST /api/v1/customers` |
| Auth | None — public (SC-4 lists registration as the sole public endpoint) |
| CSRF | Exempt for this path only (OD-002:B, SC-5 architecture decision) |
| Request media type | `application/json` required; else `415` (AC-2) |
| Request body | `RegistrationRequest { email, password }`, `additionalProperties: false` |
| Idempotency | Not idempotent; a second identical call yields `409` once the first succeeds |
| Rate limiting | Out of scope (OD-005:A) |

### 4.1 Request schema `RegistrationRequest`

| Field | Type | Constraints | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `email` | string | required, `minLength 1`, `maxLength 254`, `format: email` (FluentValidation rule) | Spec §6.1, OD-001:A |
| `password` | string, `writeOnly` | required, `minLength 12`, `maxLength 72`, must contain ≥1 upper, ≥1 lower, ≥1 digit, ≥1 special | Spec §6.2, SC-1 |

- `password` is `writeOnly` — it never appears in any response schema (SC-1, SEC-3).
- The `maxLength: 72` on `password` is BCrypt's input bound. Downstream
  (TEST_WRITING, IMPLEMENTATION) treat it as **72 bytes** (spec-review F-5); the
  OpenAPI schema can only express a character count.
- Password policy is enforced twice: a FluentValidation custom rule at the
  request layer **and** a service re-check before hashing (FR-6, SC-1). The
  contract only states the observable rule.
- Validation messages for `password` must not echo the submitted value (SC-9).

### 4.2 Response schema `CustomerResponse` (`201` only)

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | integer(int64) | surrogate id |
| `email` | string | normalized (lowercase) stored value |
| `role` | string enum `[CUSTOMER]` | always `CUSTOMER` (SC-2, BR-006) |
| `createdAt` | string(date-time) | UTC, set via `AppDbContext.SaveChangesAsync` audit override (PC-6) |

No `password`, no `password_hash`, no `enabled`, no `updatedAt` (OD-004:A,
SEC-3, SEC-4).

### 4.3 Responses

| Status | Body | When |
|---|---|---|
| `201 Created` | `CustomerResponse` + `Location: /api/v1/customers/{id}` | valid input, email not taken (AC-001, AC-005) |
| `400 Bad Request` | `ErrorResponse` (+ `fieldErrors[]` for field failures) | FluentValidation failure, malformed JSON, unknown JSON field (AC-003, AC-006) |
| `409 Conflict` | `ErrorResponse`, message `"An account with this email already exists."` | email already registered, case-insensitive (AC-002, OD-003:A) |
| `415 Unsupported Media Type` | `ErrorResponse` | missing/non-JSON `Content-Type` (AC-007) |
| `500 Internal Server Error` | `ErrorResponse` | unmapped exception; no internal leak (SC-9) |

`401` / `403` are **not applicable** — the endpoint is public (Spec §8).

## 5. Acceptance Criterion → operation / response map

| Spec AC | Operation | Observable outcome in contract |
|---|---|---|
| AC-001 Successful registration | `registerCustomer` | `201` + `Location` header + `CustomerResponse` with `role = CUSTOMER` |
| AC-002 Unique email | `registerCustomer` | `409` with the OD-003:A message; no second resource |
| AC-003 Email validation | `registerCustomer` | `400` + `fieldErrors[].field = "email"` |
| AC-004 Password storage | (not API-observable) | enforced server-side; contract guarantees `password` is `writeOnly` and absent from all responses |
| AC-005 Secure response | `registerCustomer` | `CustomerResponse` schema excludes password and hash |
| AC-006 Password policy | `registerCustomer` | `400` + `fieldErrors[].field = "password"` |
| AC-007 Media type | `registerCustomer` | `415` when `Content-Type` is not `application/json` |

Every API-relevant AC is covered. AC-004 is a persistence guarantee with no
direct HTTP surface; the contract supports it negatively (no credential field
anywhere in the response schemas).

## 6. Auth model

- **Authentication:** none for `POST /api/v1/customers`. Every other endpoint
  remains deny-by-default (SC-4); this Story adds no other route.
- **Authorization:** none (`x-authorization: none`). No role or ownership check.
- **CSRF:** antiforgery-token validation disabled for this single path
  (OD-002:B). This document is the recorded architecture decision required by
  SC-5. Session/browser endpoints keep antiforgery validation enabled.
- **Session:** the endpoint creates no session and requires none.
- **Transport:** standard project transport posture; unchanged by this Story.

## 7. Error model

- Single JSON error shape from api-conventions.md AC-6: `timestamp`, `status`,
  `error`, `message`, `path`, optional `fieldErrors[]`.
- Produced only by the single `GlobalExceptionHandler` in the `Exceptions`
  namespace (AC-9, FR-10, architecture.md AD-6). Controllers never build error
  bodies.
- `message` is client-safe; never contains stack traces, SQL, class/package
  names, file paths, DB URLs, or the submitted password (SC-9, SEC-6).
- `fieldErrors[]` entries are `{ field, message }`; `field` is the JSON field
  name (`email` / `password`).
- Duplicate-email (`409`) is a deliberate, human-approved account-enumeration
  exposure (OD-003:A / SEC-8), not a default.

## 8. Conventions compliance checklist

| Convention | Status |
|---|---|
| AC-1 URI-path versioning (`/api/v1`) | ✅ `servers: /api/v1`, path `/customers` |
| AC-2 `application/json`, `415` otherwise | ✅ |
| AC-3 plural noun, `camelCase` JSON fields, no verbs | ✅ `/customers`, `createdAt` |
| AC-4 `POST /collection` → `201` + `Location` + body | ✅ |
| AC-5 error codes | ✅ `400/409/415/500` |
| AC-6 error body shape | ✅ `ErrorResponse` + `FieldError` |
| AC-7 session auth, no `Authorization` header | ✅ public endpoint, no header |
| AC-8 pagination | n/a — no collection returned by this Story |
| AC-9 single `GlobalExceptionHandler` | ✅ stated in §7 (implementation obligation) |
| SC-1 BCrypt, dual-layer policy, plaintext only inbound | ✅ `writeOnly` password, §4.1 |
| SC-2 role `CUSTOMER`, enabled | ✅ `role` enum, §4.2 |
| SC-4 deny-by-default, registration public | ✅ §6 |
| SC-5 CSRF exemption recorded | ✅ §6, OD-002:B |
| SC-9 error/log hygiene | ✅ §7 |

## 9. Open questions for downstream stages

| # | For | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | DB_DESIGN | Email normalization mechanism (OD-006:A says lowercase-in-service + plain `UNIQUE`); confirm the column length is 254 (OD-001:A) and reconcile the entity name (`Customer` vs glossary `Account`, spec-review F-6). |
| Q-2 | DB_DESIGN | Final `password_hash` column definition (persistence-conventions.md PC-9 specifies `TEXT`, non-null, 60-character BCrypt output) — spec-review F-4 (revised in v2 spec-review). |
| Q-3 | IMPLEMENTATION | Confirm `JsonSerializerOptions.UnmappedMemberHandling = JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow` is set and the resulting `JsonException` is mapped to `400` (§3). |
| Q-4 | TEST_WRITING | Password max is 72 **bytes** for multi-byte input (spec-review F-5), not 72 characters as the schema states. |

None of these block the contract.
